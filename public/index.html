						This is my official little website slash blog, I am a 21 years old programmer from Russia, currently living in Israel.<br>
						I've been working on a project named `Stunt Evolution Freeroam`, a SA:MP server which closed on 30th June, 2018.<br>
						I code in Javascript, a bit in Golang and am passionate about the Rust language.<br>
						Currently I am serving in the military and spending most of my free time on hanging with friends and working on a private project.
						<br><br>
						I'll be writing about different ideas that I want to share with public or `Earth` members.<br>
						Some of the articles are hidden and some aren't, my ideas target specific audience that I wish to show the content to.<br>
						I am not sure whether I'll be writing about my adventures, not yet had any that I'd like to share and/or tell about.
